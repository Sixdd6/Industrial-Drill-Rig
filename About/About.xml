  <targetVersion>0.18.0</targetVersion>
  <description>Includes a new drilling rig that allows you to mine up small amounts of metals, not intended as a primary source of metal but a good option for playing on flat maps after you've exhausted all of your mineral supplies.\n\n Requires power and chemfuel and doesn't get much each time but it's better than nothing.\n\n This version includes support for base game only.</description>
