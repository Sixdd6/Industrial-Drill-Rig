# Industrial-Drill-Rig
Includes a new drilling rig that allows you to mine up small amounts of metals, not intended as a primary source of metal but a good option for playing on flat maps after you’ve exhausted all of your mineral supplies.

Requires a lot of power and doesn’t get much each time but it’s better than nothing.

Has built-in support for Cupro’s Alloys and Expanded Power metals.
